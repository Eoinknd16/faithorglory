Introduction
Faith or Glory is a turn based strategy game with some RPG elements. Faith or Glory is made up of four factions, each with their own god, mythology, religion and disciples. Oh, and there's a morality system, so be good! Or don’t…

Faith or Glory can be played by 2, 4 or 8 players. There are 4 factions to choose from. Each faction has its own traits, pros and cons. Once each player has selected their faction, if you are playing with 2 players, then just 2 factions will be in play. If you are playing with 4 or 8 players, all 4 factions will be in play. In 4 player mode, 1 player controls their own faction. In 8 player mode, there are 2 players to a faction, each with their own, independent decisions to make. Or make the decisions together, whatever, it's your game. 

The goal of each faction is to convert the entire play area to their factions' religion, and in turn, worship their god and only their god. Once the whole board has been converted by a single faction, that faction, their god, can be summoned and the game will be won. There is no second place, there are only losers. 
Objective
Your goal is to summon your god. To do this, you must gather enough divine energy. You can gather divine energy by converting towns and villages. The amount of divine energy required to summon your god is equal to the number of towns and villages combined. 
Components
TBD
Setup
Start by placing all the towns, villages and resource nodes randomly. Or not randomly, again, it’s your game.
The player/team who places the towns, villages and resource nodes will be the player/team to get last pick of the factions. (Just to avoid tomfoolery)

Each faction starts the game with the following:
1 Prophet (Unit)
1 Holy relic (Faction specific) OR swap them around… if you want to
5 Gold (Currency)

Factions & Religions
Greek - Helios
Faction name: The Sunborn Legion OR The Sunishers (TBD)
Religion: Hyperionism – Hyperion is Helios’ father - suggesting the ultimate sun worship
God: Helios, the sun god
Holy relic: Radiant sceptre
Advantage rolls: Charisma, Intelligence (roll two dice and take higher number)

Core beliefs: teaches that beauty is divinity, and those who reflect the "true light" of the divine, through wealth, radiance, or charisma are holy. They believe the soul is a reflection of the divine self, and that to shine brighter is to become godlike.

Theme: Wealth, vanity, light, illusion

Passive traits: Radiant influence - Hyperionists can project their divine radiance to influence others, bending their wills and inspiring devotion. This passive ability boosts the effectiveness of their Charisma-based actions (such as conversions or diplomacy) and applies a subtle aura of divine light to nearby allies.
Effect: All Charisma-based skill checks (such as converting disciples, charming enemy factions, or influencing NPCs) gain a +1 bonus per turn
Allied units within a 1-space radius of a Hyperionist unit gain a bonus to morale (+1 on attack rolls and defence) as long as they remain within range of the light of the Sceptre of Helios or another Holy Relic.
Rationale: This reflects Hyperionism's focus on radiance and influence. It gives them a subtle but constant advantage in social interactions and unit support, mirroring how the sun's light touches everything in its path.

Good Hyperionists use their radiance to uplift and heal others, symbolizing the nurturing aspect of the sun.

Evil Hyperionists hoard power, consume others' "reflections," and use charm and illusion to control others.
Relic - Radiant Sceptre - Info - TBD


Norse - Hel (Hela)
Faction name: Children of the Veil
Religion: Hel walkers
God: Hel 
Holy relic: The Candle of Niflheim
Advantage rolls: TBD

Core beliefs: TBD
Theme: TBD

Passive traits: Veil of Shadows - 
Effect: Units within 1 tile of the relic are granted stealth for 1 turn (cannot be targeted by enemies unless they act or are within a specific range, determined by the enemy’s perception ability).
Rationale: This passive trait can help Children of the Veil units avoid damage during critical turns and create more tactical opportunities for ambushes, surprise attacks, or quick retreats. It also complements the faction's theme of manipulating the realm of spirits and shadows.

Good Hel Walkers - They view death as a peaceful transition and seek to guide souls to rest. They believe in helping the lost and offering salvation to both the living and the dead.

Evil Hel walkers - They seek to dominate death itself, trapping souls for power and control. They manipulate the spirits to do their bidding, using fear and manipulation to maintain their control over both the living and the dead.


Celtic - Danu (Earth mother // Mother of the race of gods)
Faction name: The Druids
Religion: The Earth Mother’s Blessing
God: Danu - Earth Mother
Holy relic: The Cauldron of Dagda (In Celtic mythology, the Cauldron of Dagda is a powerful magical artifact that never empties and can provide an endless supply of food and drink. It represents abundance and life.) Cauldron of plenty
Advantage rolls: WIS, NAT (nature)

Core beliefs: TBD
Theme: TBD

Passive traits: Endless Harvest - 
Effect: Each town controlled by the Druids produces an additional 1 Gold per turn. This represents the Cauldron’s power to nourish and sustain, ensuring the Druid faction remains rich in resources. (May change to only the town the relic is in if this is too strong)

Rationale: The Cauldron's abundance influences the land, allowing the Druids to harvest the natural wealth from their surroundings.

Good - Use the Cauldron of Dagda’s power to protect, heal, and restore balance to nature.

Evil - Use the Cauldron of Dagda’s power to exploit, corrupt, and control nature for personal gain.

Egyptian - Sekhmet (Goddess of war, personification of the eye of Ra/the fury of Ra)
Faction name: Sons of the Eye
Religion: Iretu Isfet -”The eyes of chaos”
God: Sekhmet - The goddess of war
Holy relic: Eye of Ra
Advantage rolls: STR, DEX

Core beliefs: The Sons of the Eye believe that Sekhmet’s fury is the true force that keeps the world in balance. While others may see chaos as destructive, they view it as a force of creation. By embracing war and chaos, the balance of life is maintained, for without destruction, there is no creation.
Theme: TBD

Passive traits: Fury of Ra
Effect: +1 to attack rolls in 1 tile radius

Rationale: 

Good - TBD
Evil - TBD
